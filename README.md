# Typescrift Introduectin.
## what is Typescrift..?
####  =>.TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

 ## 1.Superset of JavaScript:
 #### TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it encompasses all of JavaScript's features while adding additional capabilities. Any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

 ## 2.Static Typing:
 #### Unlike JavaScript, which is dynamically typed, TypeScript allows you to declare types for variables, function parameters, return values, and more. This helps catch errors at compile-time, rather than at runtime, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code quality.

 ## 3.Transpiling to JavaScript:
 #### TypeScript code needs to be "transpiled" to JavaScript to run in browsers or Node.js environments. The TypeScript Compiler (tsc) converts TypeScript code into JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any environment where JavaScript runs.

 ## Advanced Features:
 ### TypeScript includes features like:
 ####      .Interfaces: Define contracts for classes or objects.
 ####      .Enums: Create enumerated types for fixed sets of values.
 ####      .Generics: Write flexible code that works with different types.
 ####      .Namespaces and Modules: Organize code into logical units.
 ####      .Decorators: Add metadata or functionality to classes, methods, or properties.
 ## 6.Enhanced Tooling and IDE Support:
 #### TypeScript's static typing enables better tooling in integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors. Features like code autocompletion, error highlighting, and refactoring are greatly improved with TypeScript.
